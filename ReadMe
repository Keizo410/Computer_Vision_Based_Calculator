1. This is an application for simple calculation based on drawn letters on the screen. 
2. It will require the following functions: 
- Identifying hands
- Finding the finger tips
- If index finger pointing, then the drawing starts on the screen. 
- If index & middle finger pointing, then the eraser starts. 
- It will track the numbers and operators written by hand on another screen or stream so that we can identify the calculation. 
- We need Neural Networks to recognize the numbers and operators.
- Now calculate the results and show the result on the screen.
